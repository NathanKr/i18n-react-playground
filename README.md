<h2>Motivation</h2>
Following <a href='https://github.com/NathanKr/i18n-ts-vanilla-playground'>i18n-ts-vanilla-playground</a> it is clear how to do it very easyly but two issues bother me
<ul>
<li>Is there a better way to do it</li>
<li>How to do it in react</li>
</ul>


<h2>Implementation - actually none</h2>
in view of <a href='https://github.com/NathanKr/i18n-ts-vanilla-playground'>i18n-ts-vanilla-playground</a> from one hand and looking at Lee Robinson <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDYCw5KC7s'>video</a> and <a href='https://github.com/leerob/cern-next'>github repository</a> i have realized that he does not use any i18n libraries and it is working nicely. He does use i18n with relation to routing but this has nothing to do with react

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
use the same solution as in <a href='https://github.com/NathanKr/i18n-ts-vanilla-playground'>i18n-ts-vanilla-playground</a> but simply put the language objects on files as Lee did but add interface.
